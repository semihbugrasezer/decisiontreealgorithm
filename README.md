Task: Prediction Using Decision Tree Algorithm
Problem Statement:
To Perform ‘Prediction Using Decision Tree Algorithm’ on dataset "iris".
I used Google Colab to implement a Decision Tree classifier for predicting classes. The classifier was trained and visualized graphically. The goal is to make accurate predictions for new data inputs, showcasing the classifier's ability to categorize instances into the right classes based on the trained model.
